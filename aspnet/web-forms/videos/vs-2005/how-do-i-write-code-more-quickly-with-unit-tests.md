[How Do I:] Write Code More Quickly with Unit Tests?
====================
by [Chris Menegay](https://twitter.com/CMenegay)

In this video we learn how Unit Testing can increase your productivity by easing the debugging process. We see how Visual Studio Team System can generate a Unit Test to automate execution of code that is being debugged, which saves you the time it takes to fire up your Web application and perform any steps needed to manually execute the same code. The result of Unit Testing is that you can write more robust code, more quickly.
