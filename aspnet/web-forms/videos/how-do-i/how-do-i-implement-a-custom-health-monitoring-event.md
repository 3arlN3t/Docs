[How Do I:] Implement a Custom Health Monitoring Event
====================
by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video Chris Pels will show how to create a custom health monitoring event that extends a standard health monitoring events in ASP.NET. The custom provides additional event information and formats it for a health monitoring event provider. A custom HTTP module is then created to raise the custom health monitoring event explicitly since the .NET Framework only raises the standard health monitoring events. In addition, the custom health monitoring event is raised explicitly in the page behind code for an .aspx page.
