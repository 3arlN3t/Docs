[How Do I:]  Create and Use Application Level Events in ASP.NET
====================
by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video Chris Pels will show how to create an Application Class File (Global.asax) that contains application level event handlers such as Application\_Start and Application\_BeginRequest. Then the sequence of application level events in the application lifecycle will be discussed as a basis for determining where certain types of operations would be best performed during the application lifecycle.
