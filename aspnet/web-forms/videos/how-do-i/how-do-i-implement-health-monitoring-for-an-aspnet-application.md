by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video Chris Pels will show how to implement health monitoring to get detailed run-time information for an ASP.NET application. Learn the powerful and flexible configuration options for health monitoring including health monitoring events, aka web events, providers for storing data, rules for mapping events to providers, profiles for commonly used settings, and buffermode to optimize health monitoring for best performance.
