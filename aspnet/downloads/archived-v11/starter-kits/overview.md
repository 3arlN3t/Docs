ASP.NET 1.1 Starter Kits
====================
Several starter kits were provided for learning how to develop with ASP.NET 1.x. Although these starter kits are still available, the current recommendation is to use the [MVC Music Store](../../../mvc/overview/older-versions/mvc-music-store/mvc-music-store-part-1.md) as your starting point.

- [Commerce Starter Kit](commerce.md)
- [Reports Starter Kit](reports.md)
- [Issue Tracker Starter Kit](issue-tracker.md)
- [Community Starter Kit](community.md)
- [Portal Starter Kit](portal.md)
