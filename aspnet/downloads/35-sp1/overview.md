[**ASP.NET Dynamic Data**](../../web-forms/videos/aspnet-dynamic-data/getting-started-with-dynamic-data.md "Watch the Video")  
ASP.NET Dynamic Data helps you quickly build a fully customizable, data-driven application without writing code. Dynamic Data provides a rich scaffolding framework that is easily extensible by using the traditional ASP.NET programming model.

[**ASP.NET AJAX browser history**](../../web-forms/videos/aspnet-35/aspnet-ajax/introduction-to-aspnet-ajax-history.md "Watch the Video")  
ASP.NET AJAX history provides support for navigating *within* an AJAX application by using the Forward and Back buttons in the browser.

[**ASP.NET AJAX script combining**](../../web-forms/videos/aspnet-35/aspnet-ajax/using-script-combining-to-improve-ajax-performance.md "Watch the Video")  
The ASP.NET AJAX script combining feature improves the performance of AJAX applications by reducing the number of scripts that have to be individually downloaded to the browser.


[![](overview/_static/image3.jpg)](../../web-forms/videos/aspnet-35/aspnet-ajax/adonet-data-services-with-aspnet-ajax-support.md "Watch the Video")

[**ADO.NET Data Services**](../../web-forms/videos/aspnet-35/aspnet-ajax/adonet-data-services-with-aspnet-ajax-support.md "Watch the Video")  
ADO.NET Data Services provide new services that find, manipulate and deliver data over the web using simple URIs. Benefits include an easy and flexible way to access data over the web, while enabling the separation of presentation and data access code.


See the [readme](readme.md) for more information about how to use these features in existing ASP.NET and ASP.NET AJAX applications, and about how to work with these features in applications that were created with the ASP.NET 3.5 Extensions December 2007 CTP release.
